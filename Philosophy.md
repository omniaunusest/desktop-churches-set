### 1. Core Values

1. **Clear Structure:** Organize the repository with dedicated sections for each *church* and general information.
2. **Consistency:** Maintain uniform formatting, naming conventions, and user interactions across all scripts.
    - Naming conventions
        - about scripts:    
        ``church_of_[function].py`` (e.g., ``church_of_icons.py``, ``church_of_new_wave.py``).

        - about functions:  
        Use of descriptive names (e.g., ``to_ico()``, ``wave_distortion()``).
        ---

3. **Clarity:** Use of simplified language. Code and documentation should be straightforward and accessible.
    - Avoid jargon. Explain technical terms briefly, it doesnt't hurt (e.g., "CLI: Command-Line Interface").

    - Keep functions small and focused.
    ---

4. **User Empathy:** Assume the user is intelligent but unfamiliar with the codebase. Guide them with clear prompts, helpful errors and intuitive workflows.

5. **Readability:** Use of visual context (ASCII art) with purpose, not as pointless decoration.
    - ASCII art should enhance understanding or theme, not clutter the space.

    - Be concise, not cryptic.
    - Keep the balance between technical precision and creative expression
    ---

6. Professional Touch:
    - Link to official documentation for libraries (e.g., [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)).
    - Include brief descriptions of what each library does:
        - **Pillow (PIL):** Python Imaging Library for opening, manipulating and saving images.
        - **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations, used here for efficient pixel manipulation.
        - ...

    - Clearly state the license (MIT) and include author information.
    - Credit contributors and third-party tools appropriately.

7. **Lore Matters:** The thematic elements (religious metaphors, ASCII art and text commands) should reinforce the project’s identity and make it memorable, not pointless.

8. **Lore Matters but... Practical Sense goes First**.
---

### 2. Thematic Integration
New scripts should fit within the *church* metaphor.

ASCII art, naming, and descriptions should align with the project’s lore.

--- 
### 3. Roadmap
- **Short-Term:**
  - Add customizable output filenames and formats for all scripts.
  - Implement batch processing.
- **Long-Term:**
  - Expand the set with more "churches" (e.g., ``Church of Ascension`` for image upscaling).
  - Develop a unified CLI for all scripts.
  - Create a tutorial or guide for extending the project.
